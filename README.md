Homework 7 for BAIS:3300

Description of the project:
Purpose of this project is practice how to create web form and also be familiar with git and github. Through this project, I learned 4 types of questions to collect data.

How my web form conforms to best pratcies? & what specifically did you do on your assignment that is a best practice?:
My web form contains all 4 types of questions that mentioned in "BAIS3300_HW7_HTML web form.pdf" which are input boxes, radio buttons, dropdown boxes, and checkboxes. Additionally, I added textarea so students can answer in sentences. At the end of the each page, I added progress bar which will increase the completion rate and also I added reset button so students can reset their answers with one click.
